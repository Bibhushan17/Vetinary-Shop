     background-color:grey; padding:15px; width:85%;">At Sangam Veterinary Clinic, we offer a range of wellness care services to keep your pets healthy and happy.
     We recommend annual wellness visits for both dogs and cats. At these visits, we perform thorough physical exams, vaccinate or run blood titers to see if vaccines are needed, and test dogs for heartworm disease, tick-borne diseases, and intestinal parasites. We emphasize preventative medicine, dental care, and nutrition as well as address any questions or concerns you have about your pet. While we recommend that all pets visit us at least once a year, more frequent exams can better help prevent disease and chronic problems, especially in older animals.

            The Importance of Wellness Visits for Our Feline Friends:-

                    We know how difficult it can be to take your cat to the vet. He hates the carrier! He hides under the bed. He howls non-stop and then urinates from the stress. She gets home and won’t speak to you for a week. And since your cat, being a cat, will do everything in his power to hide any sign of illness or discomfort, he seems fine. So, why go to the vet?
                </li>
                <br>
                <li >   
                    We believe annual comprehensive wellness examinations are important for all cats, no matter their age and apparent health. Senior cats or those with chronic conditions should be seen more frequently. These visits give us a chance to discuss and assess your cat’s diet and appetite, gastrointestinal health, urinary habits, and any behavior changes that might indicate something is going on. In addition, we talk about your cat’s lifestyle, environmental enrichment, disease and parasite prevention, and what to expect as your cat grows older.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    An appointment always begins with one of our veterinarians getting a full history of how your cat has been doing at home since his last visit. During this time, your cat has a chance to relax and get acclimated to his new surroundings. A thorough physical examination is performed to detect conditions that may affect your cat’s health before they become unmanageable, painful, or more costly to treat. We will listen for heart murmurs and look for dental tartar and gingivitis, tooth resorption, weight loss, weight gain, lumps, and any abnormal size or shape of abdominal organs. In some cases, we’ll recommend blood and/or urine tests to assess overall organ function and internal health. Early detection of any problem is the goal. Diabetes, if caught early, can sometimes be managed or even reversed with a diet change alone. We always want to treat hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) before it leads to high blood pressure, structural heart changes, and kidney damage. And the earlier we are able to treat painful periodontal disease and tooth resorption, the happier your cat’s life will be!

                    We try to make your cat’s visit as easy as possible! At Sangam Veterinary Clinic, we emphasize low stress handling of our patients. We focus on having a quiet environment, taking our time, minimizing the amount and strength of restraint, and rewarding our patients with delicious treats and praise. We believe that these techniques set us apart from other animal hospitals.
                    But no amount of gentleness on our part will necessarily make getting your cat here any easier.
